## TO GET THE HELP FILE, run 'mp3_check -h', otherwise it will seem
## to hang (it is listening to stdin).

This program is pretty straight forward. Simply do:

1) make
2) make install

Program output can be tweaked a little for easier reading, but the
most important thing is that it gives you the data to see if the 
mp3 is good or not.

Comments are encouraged.  If you use this program, send me an e-mail,
and tell me what you think, and where it can be improved. Keep in mind,
I don't mind suggestions, but if you got a possible solution, that is 
even better. :)

p.s. I have included the .spec file so you can create your own .src.rpm files.
