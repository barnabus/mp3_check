Hello Fellow Developer!

Two key areas need alot of help to keep mp3_check from having future
difficulty they are as follows:

1) It is becoming more and more difficult to analyze the mp3 when it is
coming from two different sources (ie. either a stream or a file). I
have made initial steps to providing that framework to help you get
started. What I planned on is that to create a buffer that can store
the entire mp3 frame, then analyze the buffer (easier to seek back and
forth). I think this is key for doing CRC and other types of analysis.

2) I know I had already mentioned CRC checking, but I would like to take
it one step further. I would like to be able to add the CRC16 checksum
into a mp3 file after the file has already been completed. I feel this
would be a nice touch. If #1 above could be done, this would be quite
easy to do.

I had a hard time finding a CRC16 checksum algorithm written in C, but
I finally did, and it is now included in the source. I have tested the
code, and it works correctly.

I have alot of comments in the code, so it should help guide you.

p.s. Because I spend too much time working, I have a hard time keeping up
with my e-mail. If you would like to correspond with other developers,
please take advantage of the mp3_check ksite at sourceforge by going to
https://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=6126. If you have questions
for me, plese send me an e-mail.

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide,

Sincerely,

Eric Bullen ericb@thedeepsky.com
