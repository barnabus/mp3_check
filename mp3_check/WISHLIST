Here's a not so complete wish list that I think would be nice:

1) Improvements to the frame checking logic?

2) crc16 checking/adding of the frame would also be nice since I am able to
retrieve the 'protection bit' from the frame.

3) id3v2 support and analysis.

Any additional requests, please send them to me at ericb@thedeepsky.com.
 Thanks for all the e-mails from you out there for how you are using mp3_check.
I really enjoy hearing from you. KEEP THEM COMING!!! :)


I would really like to get your testimonials of how you are using it. :)
