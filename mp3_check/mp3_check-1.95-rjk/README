## TO GET THE HELP FILE, run 'mp3_check -h', otherwise it will seem
## to hang (it is listening to stdin).

===================================
Official mp3_check website is located on SourceForge. Here's the URL:

https://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=6126


Thanks go to the SourceForge staff for making such an awesome
service available for the community!

===================================
This program is pretty straight forward. Simply do:

1) tar zxfv mp3_check-<version>.tar.gz
2) cd mp3_check-<version>
3) make
4) make install

Program output can be tweaked a little for easier reading, but the
most important thing is that it gives you the data to see if the 
mp3 is good or not.

Comments are encouraged.  If you use this program, send me an e-mail,
and tell me what you think, and where it can be improved. Keep in mind,
I don't mind suggestions, but if you got a possible solution, that is 
even better. :)
