These are the people that were nice enough to send me their patches
and improvements. If you can't code, you can still help by
trying to find any problems that I didn't catch. Also, tell me
how you are using it in your daily activities. :)
====================================================================

Sun 4-Jun-00: Thanks go to charles <charles@source.rebelbase.com> for his
patch to dynamically check to see if the stream is coming from stdin or
from a file. This yields a HUGE speed improvement. My tests show it 
shaves about 88% of the time to check an mp3. 

Thu 25-May-00: Thanks go to Steven Wilcoxon <swilcoxon@uswest.net> for 
laying the groundwork for support of id3v2. He also corrected the last 
of my really bad english slang spellings. :)

Thu 25-May-00: Thaks go to Zach Zurflu <zack@pabst.bendnet.com> for 
making the FreeBSD port possible. 

Tue 23-May-00: Thanks to Zach Zurflu <zack@pabst.bendnet.com> for
pointing out some issues with the command-line options. Because
of this, I was able to spot some other code-cleanups (related to
the command-line options) to make things run even more predictable.

Mon 15-May-00: Thanks to Charles Kerr <charles@superpimp.org> for
his patch to make mp3_check more portable by removing dependencies
for GNU libc. Should work great under Solaris now. Also, he shaved
~10% off the time it takes to analyze an mp3.

Sun 14-May-00: Thanks to Adam Bernstein <no6@pobox.com> for his
contributions for detecting a bug when determining VBR sample rates in
long mp3s and supplying a patch.

Mon 01-May-00: Thanks to Tollef Fog Heen <tollef@add.no> for some speed
improvements to the code. His patch included some corrections to my
english slang. I guess it was time to clean that up. :)

Sun 16-Apr-00: Thanks to Reuben <reuben@moderngroove.com> for giving
me the info to get mp2 support working right. Also, thanks go to Jussi
Alanara <jalanara@dc.turkuamk.fi> for asking me to improve the returning
of error codes.

Fri 31-Mar-00: Although Robert James Kaes's patch has been removed
with a faster algorithm, I would still like to give him credit for his
contributions.

Wed 29-Mar-00: Thanks go to Robert James Kaes <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
for his contribution to the optimizations in rotate_char_array.
