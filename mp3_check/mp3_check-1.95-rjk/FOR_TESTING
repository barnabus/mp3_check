Here's a little something that will help in spotting problems
with the addition of new features...




1) Take a known good mp3, and run:

md5sum <mp3_file.mp3>

Then run mp3_check -a -sf <mp3_file.mp3> > <new_mp3.mp3>

They should be the same (by comparing the md5sums of both mp3s).

This will try to fix an already good mp3, and thus should 
not make any changes.

** Especially with VBR files.





2) Take a known good mp3, cut it in half, and add some junk
in the center (dd if=/dev/zero of=junk bc=2000) and glue it all
back (with the junk in the middle).

Then run mp3_check -a -sf <mp3_file.mp3> > <new_mp3.mp3>

I would like it to be able to strip out the junk, and return
the original mp3, but I don't think it works quite yet.

Anyone willing to take a look at this? :)

3) Take a known good mp3, and run:

md5sum <mp3_file.mp3>

Then run mp3_check -a -s <mp3_file.mp3> > <new_mp3.mp3>

They should be the same (without fixing anything).








Any other tests are welcome. :)
