Now is able to grab the 2 CRC bytes, and display them per frame.

Checking of contiguous frames now happens. You can set what the mininum
is by using the '-q' option.

Got rid of all the loose variables, grouped them together and then put
them into structures for easier management. Other logic improvements.

1.9

I am not sure why I didn't include this one. Ug.

1.8

Added a -e option to control the behavior of how errors are generated when
an id3v2 tag is found. Made some changes to the print_usage() function that
hopefully corrects problems on some systems. Added preliminary id3v2 support,
and hopefully soon id3v2 analysis. I hear this is a big job. :-/

The BSDs should be able to compile mp3_check with no problems now. Please note
that to do this, you have to run 'make bsd_install'. Take a look at the Makefile
if you have any questions.


1.7 

Added a -p option.
Fixed obscure flag combination that would cause '-b' not to work correctly.
Other general code cleanup. Nothing really special.
