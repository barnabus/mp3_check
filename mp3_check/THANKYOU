These are the people that were nice enough to send me their patches
and improvements. If you can't code, you can still help by
trying to find any problems that I didn't catch. Also, tell me
how you are using it in your daily activities. :)
====================================================================

Fri 15-Sep-00: Thanks to Norbert Tretkowski <nobse@nexus.nobse.de> from  
the Debian crew for pointing out a memory deallocation problem. 
Things are looking good now.

Fri 28-Jul-00: Thanks to Steve Lhomme <steve@uuuu.org> for his porting
of mp3_check to Win32. Made a change in fopen to work better with
windows compilers.

Fri 17-Jun-00: Thanks go to Robert James Kaes <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
for his lengthy contributions. They haven't been merged yet, but
perhaps someone would be interested in this. :) There's a directory
called mp3_check-1.95-rjk in the source dir that contains the files.
Here's a list of what he accomplished:

    * autoconfed the source (uses configure now).
    * changed all the C++ style comments to C style since some compilers
      can not handle C++ style when compiling C code.
    * split the source into id3.c, init.c, print.c, mp3_check.c,
      mp3_check_misc.c, and support_functions.c. They all share a common
      mp3_check.h
    * cleaned up the print_usage function.
    * added the appropriate files for GNU standard compliance.
    * fixed the formating so the lines fit on an 80 column screen.
    * fixed the function prototypes to be ANSI compliant.
    * added the reconf script which is needed if configure.in or
      Makefile.am are changed.


Sun 4-Jun-00: Thanks go to charles <charles@source.rebelbase.com> for his
patch to dynamically check to see if the stream is coming from stdin or
from a file. This yields a HUGE speed improvement. My tests show it 
shaves about 88% of the time to check an mp3. 

Thu 25-May-00: Thanks go to Steven Wilcoxon <swilcoxon@uswest.net> for 
laying the groundwork for support of id3v2. He also corrected the last 
of my really bad english slang spellings. :)

Thu 25-May-00: Thaks go to Zach Zurflu <zack@pabst.bendnet.com> for 
making the FreeBSD port possible. 

Tue 23-May-00: Thanks to Zach Zurflu <zack@pabst.bendnet.com> for
pointing out some issues with the command-line options. Because
of this, I was able to spot some other code-cleanups (related to
the command-line options) to make things run even more predictable.

Mon 15-May-00: Thanks to Charles Kerr <charles@superpimp.org> for
his patch to make mp3_check more portable by removing dependencies
for GNU libc. Should work great under Solaris now. Also, he shaved
~10% off the time it takes to analyze an mp3.

Sun 14-May-00: Thanks to Adam Bernstein <no6@pobox.com> for his
contributions for detecting a bug when determining VBR sample rates in
long mp3s and supplying a patch.

Mon 01-May-00: Thanks to Tollef Fog Heen <tollef@add.no> for some speed
improvements to the code. His patch included some corrections to my
english slang. I guess it was time to clean that up. :)

Sun 16-Apr-00: Thanks to Reuben <reuben@moderngroove.com> for giving
me the info to get mp2 support working right. Also, thanks go to Jussi
Alanara <jalanara@dc.turkuamk.fi> for asking me to improve the returning
of error codes.

Fri 31-Mar-00: Although Robert James Kaes's patch has been removed
with a faster algorithm, I would still like to give him credit for his
contributions.

Wed 29-Mar-00: Thanks go to Robert James Kaes <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
for his contribution to the optimizations in rotate_char_array.
